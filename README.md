# Classification-on-Wine-Dataset

This Wine Classification project is designed to demonstrate the process of classifying wines based on their attributes. Wine dataset is a publicly available dataset which contains information about different types of wines, including their chemical composition. For classification, logistic regression is used in Pytorch and TensorFlow. Linear regression is also experimented on the same dataset.
